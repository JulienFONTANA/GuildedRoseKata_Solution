# Guilded Rose Kata Solution

## Rules
This Kata is all about refactoring legacy code.
The requirements are in the solution.

### Steps
I had to hard copy my work and losts most of the commit I had done...
So here is how I proceded :
* I read the specifications and took notes
* I then quickly read the code
* I wrote tests to cover every aspects of the existing code
* I wrote a specific calculator for each items
* I safely removed duplicated tests

I tried to keep in mind the SOLID principles at every steps.

## Why C#.NET ?
C# is my main coding language. I wanted to do a bit of TDD to train.
I'd like to keep it as simple as possible, clear, but most importantly 
keep the whole project open to change and modifications !

Besides the standard .NET librairies I will use NUnit and NFluent.
